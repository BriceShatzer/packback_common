## Requirements

You'll need to have the following items installed before continuing.

  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): Use the installer provided on the NodeJS website.
  * [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/): Run `[sudo] npm install -g gulp`
  * [Bower](http://bower.io/): Make sure Bower is installed globally `[sudo] npm install bower -g`

## Quickstart

`>> npm install && bower install` (This will install all dependencies required for gulp to work.)

While you're working on your project, run:

`>> gulp`

And you're set!

## Directory Structure

  * `assets/scss/main.scss`: Application styles go here.
  * `assets/scss/_settings.scss`: Configure Foundation settings here.
  * `build/`: compiled versions of Sass go here.
